#### [TTSVoiceWizardLatest.pyw](TTSVoiceWizardLatest.pyw)

I have multiple versions of this saved in the same folder so this just lets me launch the latest with a single click. This is fairly smol so it's self documenting but could adapted for multiple different things by swapping out the path and pattern search strings.
